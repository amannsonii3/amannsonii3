# Hey there! 👋 I'm Aman Soni

### 🧬 Computational Chemist | DFT Enthusiast | MLIP Developer

> *"Automating all of nature calculated through eigenstates and eigenvalues"*

I specialise in **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs)**, working at the intersection of quantum chemistry and artificial intelligence to solve complex materials science problems.


Current Focus 🎯 
- Investigating the role of the "**_attention_**" mechanism in interpreting our physical reality.


Technical Arsenal 🛠️
- **Quantum Chemistry**: DFT calculations, electronic structure theory
- **Computational Tools**: pymatgen, ASE, VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, Gaussian, MACE

### 🧠 Philosophy

I believe in the power of computational science to unlock nature's secrets, where every eigenstate tells a story, and every eigenvalue holds a key to understanding our world at the atomic level.

> *Adaptable by nature, driven by curiosity, powered by quantum mechanics.*
